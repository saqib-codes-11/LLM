    "solution_code": "To vectorize this operation, we can use Numpy's built-in scalar multiplication feature, which automatically applies the operation to each element in a multi-dimensional array. The Numpy library is specifically designed to handle such operations efficiently.\n\nThe vectorized version of the code will be simply:\n```Python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef function(A, s):\n    result = np.array(A) * s\n    return result\n```\nThis code first converts the input list `A` into a Numpy array using the `np.array` function. It then multiplies the array by the scalar `s` using the * operator. The result is a new array with the same shape as the original, where each element is the product of the corresponding element in the original array and the scalar. This is equivalent to the goal of the original function.",
