The algorithm follows the steps:\n1. Create a variable `left` and set it as 0\n2. Create a variable `right` and set it as the length of `s` minus one\n3. Create a variable `sList` and set it as the list of `s`\n4. Create a variable `vowels` and set it as a list containing 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'\n5. Iterate while `left` is lower than `right`\n\t1. If the character at index `left` of `sList` is a vowel:\n\t\t- Iterate while `right` is higher than `left`\n\t\t\t- If the character at index `right` of `sList` is a vowel:\n\t\t\t\t- Swap the characters at indices `left` and `right` of `sList`\n\t\t\t\t- Decrement `right` by one\n\t\t\t\t- break the loop\n\t\t\t- Decrement `right` by one\n\t\t- Increment `left` by one\n6.
