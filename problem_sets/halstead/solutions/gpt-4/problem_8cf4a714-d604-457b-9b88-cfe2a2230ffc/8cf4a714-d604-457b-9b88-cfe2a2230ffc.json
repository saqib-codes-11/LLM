    "solution_code": "# Assumptions and Approach:\n* n will be an integer between 1 and 200.\n* For any given n, the nth number in the series is 7 times the (n-1)th number in the sequence and 3 times the (n-2)th number in the sequence.\n* The function needs to determine this nth number in the given sequence. The sequence starts as follows: a(1) = 9, a(2) = 12, then a(3) = 7*a(2)-3*a(1)+10, etc.\n\nWe will write a function solve(n) that will take an integer as its input and return the last digit of the nth number in the sequence defined above. Funny thing about the sequence is that we are asked to calculate the last digit of a(n). As we only need the last digit, we can simply store the last digit of a(n) and a(n-1) while calculating a previous values. We will proceed as follows:\n* start with the first 2 values set. Set a_temp to be the 2nd value, and old_temp to be the 1st value.\n* continue to iterate until i = n. At each iteration, we will calculate a new number in the sequence. The next number will be last digit of (7 times previous number - 3 times number before that + 10).\n* As the goal is the last digit, we are only keeping track of the last digit of a_temp and old_temp.\n* i will be used as a counter, we will continue until i=n.\n* At each step/iteration, a_temp gets the new value and old_temp gets the value that a_temp had before updating in that step.\n\n# Pseudo-code\n* initiate old_temp = 9; a_temp = 12\n* for i in range(3,n+1):\n * new number = a_temp *7 - old_temp*3 +10\n * last digit of new number = new number % 10\n * old_temp = a_temp\n * a_temp = last digit of new number\n* return a_temp, which represents the last digit of the nth number in the sequence\nAfter solving this problem, we will test it for a few test cases, and review and optimize the solution as needed. \n\nThe given sequence does not seem to have an obvious pattern and calculating the nth number will require information on the previous 2 numbers at least. So, it seems the complexity of this solution will have to be O(n). Additionally, as the function focuses on saving and using only the last digit of each number, it seems to be reasonably optimized for space as well.",
